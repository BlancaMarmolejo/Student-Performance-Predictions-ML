The following machine learning project aims to use student characteristics to predict performance.  I am mainly interested in the score for a math test.  As a former professor, I would like to see if it is possible to predict the weak students in order to provide them with more support.  This can often be implemented through providing extended office hours for such students or referral to the university's tutoring center.  We can also provide other tutorial suggestions or study options both in class as well as helping the students to form groups with other students who are stronger in the subject and may provide them with peer feedback.  The sooner we can spot students who may be in trouble, the sooner we can provide them with help.
